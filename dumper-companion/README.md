# Dumper Companion

Old Macintosh CD-ROMs use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System](HFS),
a format that modern operating systems can't natively handle.

This companion program extracts game data from an HFS disk image and formats it for use in ScummVM.

This contains code ported/adapted from:
