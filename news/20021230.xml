.. to everybody except Casa Addams, many users on the Clie Source forums (whom obviously have brains as big as their PDAs,) and that
other idiot who is bundling ScummVM with warez LucasArts games on UseNet. This is somewhat of an open plee, although we do not really
expect morons who have done something so idiotic to listen.

Sorry for this open message being so harsh guys, but do you not realise that by associating ad bundling ScummVM <b>with</b> pirated
copies (&quot;Abandonware&quot; or otherwise) of LucasArts games your basically giving them even more excuse to take legal action
against us (and bring possibly financial ruin on the developers of this program :)... I'm expecially disapointed in chrilith who has
almost certainly guaranteed that, unless we feel very forgiving, there will never be an official Palm port of ScummVM integrated into
CVS.

If you appreciate what we are doing, and have done, then do not abuse it. Otherwise you are damaging the reputation, and possible 
legal status, of both ScummVM and it's developers.

In other news, Curse of Monkey Island support is progressing nicely! Be sure to try out the latest Daily Builds if you like living on 
the wild side (but of course do not file bug reports on CMI support).
