<NAME>Windows Daily Snapshots now Available</NAME>

<BODY>
	Travis Howell is making daily snapshots of ScummVM for Windows
	available for download. Kudos go out to Travis. Also, there is
	a link for a Windows GDI version of ScummVM. This version does
	not require SDL. If you are having problems getting the SDL
	version to work, give that one a try.<br>
	We have also placed a Compatibility Page online to help answer
	the most common question, "Which games work?". We will keep this
	page updated as development continues.
