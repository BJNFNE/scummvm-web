<p>
Five months after our last release, 0.3.0b, and over 2500 CVS commits/adds later, the ScummVM team proudly presents ScummVM 0.4.0.
</p>

<p>
The following is an overview of what's new in 0.4.0:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Curse of Monkey Island (comi) support (experimental)
<li>Added support for the EGA versions of Loom, Monkey Island and Indy3
<li>Improved music support in Indy3 and the floppy versions of Monkey Island
<li>Many Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2 improvements and fixes
<li>Very pre-alpha Beneath a Steel Sky code. Don't expect it to do anything (in fact it is disabled in the 0.4.0 release, but you can get it by compiling ScummVM yourself). 
<li>Even more pre-alpha support for enhanced versions of V2 SCUMM games (Maniac Mansion and Zak)
<li>Preliminary support for early Humongous Entertainment titles (very experimental)
<li>New debug console and several GUI/Launcher enhancements
<li>New Save/Load code (easier to expand while retaining compatibility)
<li>Dreamcast port now works with new games added for 0.3.0b
<li>New official PalmOS port
<li>Various minor and not so minor SCUMM game fixes
<li>Large memory leak fixed for The Dig/COMI
<li>SMUSH code optimised, frame dropping added for slower machines
<li>Code cleanups
</ul>

<p>The source code, as well as binaries for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, PocketPC, Solaris and PalmOS are already available at our <a href="downloads.php">download page</a>. Other binaries for MorphOS, Dreamcast and others, will follow shortly.
</p>

<p><i>We hope you will enjoy the best ScummVM ever!</i></p>
