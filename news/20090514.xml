The SourceForge.net Community Choice Awards 2009 have started.<br/> We invite you to support our little project by casting your vote.
</p>

<p>
The natural category for ScummVM would be <i>Best Project for Gamers</i>,<br/> though if you feel that we could be <i>Best Project</i>, we wouldn't <br/>mind much; a project can be nominated for more than one category<br/> this year.
</p>

<p>The Scary Robot is the mascot of these Awards, and in order to vote for ScummVM, click the mascot or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/nominate/?hash=038e5e297aba271e781b28ea1fa67eb3">this link</a>.
</p>

<p>We hope to see you in the finals!</p>
