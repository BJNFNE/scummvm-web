<NAME>ScummVM 0.5.0-Pre</NAME>

<BODY>
ScummVM 0.5.0 has just entered a CVS freeze and testing, to prepare for
an eventual stable release (hopefully at the end of the month). But we
need <i>YOUR</i> help!
<BR><BR>
Please click that little 'Documentation' option over there, and look at
the 0.5.0 release checklist. If there is a game that is listed as
needing testing, and you happen to feel like playing it through with the
latest development version of ScummVM, please do so and let us know the
results. Further information is on the checklist page.
<BR><BR>
Among many fixes that will be in the upcoming 0.5.0, expecially in the
area of music, comes support for three new games:
 <UL>
  <LI>Enhanced Maniac Mansion
  <LI>Enhanced Zak McKracken
  <LI><B>Beneath a Steel Sky</B>, thanks to the support of Revolution
 </UL>
<BR><BR>
In other news, Anonymous CVS is (and has been for some time) lagging
behind the official development tree. If you want the bleeding-edge CVS
(for testing, as an example), please use the 'Source Snapshot' on the
Download page over Anonymous CVS. And of course,<BR>
