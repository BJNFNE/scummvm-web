Thanks to <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</a>, we got
the opportunity to move to a more powerful and advanced versioning system than CVS:
We are now using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>,
also known as SVN. In case you wonder, a versioning system is a tool for 
collaborative software development. As you probably know, the ScummVM Team consists
of more than 30 active core developers, and many more are on our list of past and
present contributors. Working on a project on this scale just would not be
possible without the help of such a system.
</p>

<p>
From the very beginning, Ludvig Strigeus committed his initial ScummVM version to CVS, 
the versioning system we used until recently. Vincent Hamm joined him shortly 
thereafter. Since then, a lot has changed, many things have happened. We have more than 
20,000 revisions of ScummVM and its various components in our CVS repository.
</p>

<p>
We now moved to a new system, Subversion. Compared to CVS, it adds many useful new 
features, that allow us  to work more efficiently on ScummVM, something we are sure 
all our users will appreciate. Among other things, there will be no more lag between 
anonymous and developers version of the source code -- you get everything we do 
instantly!
</p>

<p>
If you used a CVS checkout so far, scrap it, install a
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">Subversion client</a> and
checkout
</p>
<pre>
   https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/
</pre>

<p>
If you are using the command line subversion client, that means you simply have to 
type the following command:
</p>
<pre>
   svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ scummvm
</pre>

<p>
You will notice that the source tree of ScummVM already changed significantly and yet 
more is to come. Stay tuned!
