   <U>CABAL team splits over fundamental design issues</U>
</P>
<P>
   After yesterdays ground-breaking announcement, we are sad to announce the immediate disbandment of the CABAL team.
   Over the last several days there has been heated debate regarding several important design issues, and current
tension in the team has risen to an insurmountable level.
</P>
<P>
   &quot;It's really unfortunate&quot;, Max Horn, senior developer on ScummVM and Exult, was quoted as saying,
&quot;but [former FreeSCI maintainer] Christoph [Reichenbach]'s ideas of aligning curly braces with the left-hand
side of function declarations while appending them to the end of the line for 'while' and 'for' loops did not make
any sense at all.&quot;<BR>
The latter replied by pointing out that &quot;using anything but tabs for indentation is calling for trouble.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Claudio Matsuoka, of the Sarien project, pointed out his disappointment and noted that he didn't see much of a
point in trying to co-operate with people entirely incapable of reaching agreements on such trivial issues. &quot;I
mean, we haven't even resolved the entire EMACS vs. vi dispute, and they're already at each other's throats
again.&quot;<BR>
James Brown, another senior developer on the ScummVM project, sadly announced that he was laughed out of the project
meer hours before a decision to split was made. &quot;They just said I didn't belong, since I prefer nano as a
editor...&quot; he admitted.
