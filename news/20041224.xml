We are proud to announce the release of ScummVM 0.7.0, right in time for Christmas Eve!
</p>
<p>
While not quite as ground breaking as some of our previous major releases, this version sports some notable improvements and additions, amongst them:
<ul>
<li>Added preliminary support for 26 Humongous Entertainment titles
<li>Added support for FLAC (lossless) encoded audio files
<li>Added native support for Macintosh versions of some SCUMM games -- this means the 'rescumm' tool is now mostly obsolete, and you can now play those games directly from the original CD
<li>Added smooth horizontal scrolling for The Dig, Full Throttle and COMI
     (matching the original engine)
<li>Added support for compressed speech and music in Broken Sword 1 and 2
<li>And as usual, we fixed lots and lots of bugs
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A link to the release notes and a more detailed list of changes can be found over on the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php">downloads page</a>, along with the download links.
Updating to this latest and greatest version is strongly recommended to all our users.
