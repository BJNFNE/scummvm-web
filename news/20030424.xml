We've recieved a number of e-mails lately asking if any work is happening on ScummVM. We would like to
reassure people that do -not- follow CVS that yes, a lot of work is happening.
</p>
<p>
We are currently gearing up for the release of 0.4.0, which should be happening within a few weeks.
I'd like to ask people who feel like living dangerously to try out CVS and Daily Build's, and let us
know of any problems we should be aware of. In the 'Documentation' section below you will see a
'Release Checklist'. Games that have been testing without any problems are marked here - please test
the games that are not marked tested, and let us know your results on the Forum. Remember to include
the date you downloaded the build you completed the game with.
</p>
<p>
At the moment we are focusing on earlier EGA games (Maniac Mansion, Zak McKraken, LoomEGA, Indy3EGA),
 although Beneath a Steel Sky support is progressing at a slow but steady pace. Somebody also recently
donated a Playstation 2 modchip to the team, so expect a native PS2 port as soon as Ender has it
installed (ScummVM already runs fine under Playstation2 Linux).
</p>

A reminder to those that are intrested in our latest progess, you can always sign up to the cvs-logs
mailing list. Click the 'Project Home' link below, and browse to the 'Lists' page. This list will
receive an e-mail every time there is a new change to the source-code, so bewarned it can be rather
technical and high-traffic. As an alternative you can just play with CVS Checkouts or Daily Builds and
discover anything new yourself :)
