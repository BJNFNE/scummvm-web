The Windows daily builds don't contain any virus's, some anti-virus scanner like <a href="http://www.free-av.com">AntiVir</a> are falsly reporting the recent xbox emulator trojan (TR/XBoxEmu.2) in all self extracting files created by <a href="SFX Maker">SFX Maker</a>
        Work on ScummVM has been proceeding very slowly of late, as the main
        devteam is quite busy on other matters.
        <BR><BR>
        We are aware of quite a few issues in Zak256 and some very serious
        ones in Simon that were found for 0.2.0, and plan to do an interm
        release (0.2.1) as soon as they are fixed. We are of course looking
        for more developers willing to help out, as there is only currently
        one person working on the game interpreter itself (although several
        are working on more specialisd parts of the engine).
        <BR><BR>
        We are also aware of a GP32 port in progress, and urge anyone who
        knows the developer to get him to contact <a href="mailto:scummvm@enderboi.com">Ender</a>.
        Besides the fact we are quite intrested in his work, and wish to invite him to
        join the team... we are quite peeved he has released binaries and there appears
        to be no way to contact him for the source code to his port (as is required by
        the GPL license ScummVM uses)!
        <BR><BR>
        Until the next update... <B>I can't pick that up! No really! Read my lips..
        I... Can't... Pick... That... Up!</B>
