I forget to mention this when we released 0.3.0b, but ScummVM has also recently been mentioned (somewhat) in a UK magazine 
recently. <i>PC Zone</i> mentioned ScummVM in a review of the iPAQ 3870. A <a 
href="/media/pczone.jpg">page scan</a> is available.

If anybody else notices a media mention of ScummVM, we would appretiate somebody dropping us a line at <a 
href="mailto:press_stuff@scummvmNOSPAM.org">press_stuff@scummvmNOSPAM.org</a>. Remove the NOSPAM from the address, obviously. If you 
do notice a mention, please send us a scan of the page (if possible).
<BR><BR>
If you WORK for a magazine that wants to mention ScummVM, possibly as an article on retro-gaming (*hint hint*), also feel free to 
drop us a line. We can probably arrange an interview, screenshots, help... and/or large bribe-like quantities of bananas.
