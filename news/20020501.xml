        Yes, we are still alive. Unfortunatly far from being ready for 0.2.0,
        several people have raised a large number of critical bugs we are
        working through. Stick with us, we'll get their eventually!

        Oh, and by the way.. if anyone knows the location of Sean Clark or
        any other person who scripted Sam and Max, please kidnap them and
        force them to explain an annoying script race in the Mystery Vortex
        which has kept several of us awake for the last 48 hours.
        <BR><BR>
        Thanks, and enjoy ScummVM :)
