Some interesting news for you. Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. has released the 
ITE Soundtrack on CD. You may listen to a preview and buy it from
<a href="http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ite/music.html">here</a>. ScummVM supports 
this game since 0.8.0 and this was mainly possible thanks to our tight
collaboration with Wyrmkeep and the fact that they kindly provided us 
with all source code and the rights to reimplement it. So you may want
to support this great company by purchasing the game soundtrack and of 
course the game itself, and play it with ScummVM.
