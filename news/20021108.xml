Greetings fellow Adventurers!

SourceForge, our host, is moving hardware on the 14th and 17th of November.
During this time, there will be a number of outages:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>14th: ScummVM Downloads and Mailing Lists will be unavailable between approximatly 16:00 Pacific Time (GMT-8), till 19:00.
<LI>17th: The main ScummVM site, and CVS tree, will be unavailable from 10:00 Pacific. This may last up to 12 hours, but hopefully 
less!

Thank you, and please shop at Snuckeys again!
