<P>
ScummVM 0.6.1 is out, and can now be grabbed from our download page!<BR>
Among the usual changes, ScummVM should now run natively on 64-bit machines -- 
something we actually forgot to mention in the NEWS file.
</P>
<P>
And you know what they say: "To save the world, you have to push a few old ladies down the 
stairs." So we made a mother-load of fixes in this release. Some of the wonderful things 
you will no LONGER see in ScummVM include:
<UL>
<LI>Glitches using an Ogg Vorbis talkie file in some games
<LI>Crashes on 64-bit machines
<LI>Crashes when saving to an invalid directory in Broken Sword 1
<LI>Lots of sound glitches in Curse of Monkey Island, Full Throttle and The Dig
<LI>Crashes in some international versions of Simon the Sorcerer
<LI>... and lots of other annoying bugs!
</UL>
</P>
<P>
So don't delay, download today. Downloads are not yet available for all supported 
ports, such as non-ARM PocketPCs and the HandheldPC binaries. These should become available
within the next week.
