        After much waiting, ScummVM 0.2.0 has been released! So head over
        to the downloads page and grab it for your favorite platform.
        <BR><BR>
        Currently we have downloads for i386 Debian Woody, Windows, Dreamcast,
        MacOSX, and Windows CE. Over the next few days we will also be adding
        downloads for MorphOS, RPMs, and maybe a BeOS download.
        <BR><BR>
        Besides many major fixes, ScummVM now supports several new games,
        such as the FmTowns 256 color version of Zak McKracken, the CD version
        of Loom, and (strangly enough) Simon the Sorcerer! Several games
        supported in 0.1.0 are now completable in 0.2.0, such as Sam and Max.
        <BR><BR>ScummVM release 0.2.0 also includes several new platforms,
        better support for different CPU architectures and endians, many
        more commandline options and experimental (eg, do not report bugs on
        it!) support for Full Throttle, The Dig, the VGA version of
        Indiana Jones and the Last Cruisade and the VGA version of Monkey Island
        (floppy).!
        <BR><BR>So don't delay. Download it now, and if you really like it, click
        that little paypal button under the menu to donate money to help the
        ScummVM team buy tools and software to continue this project.
