Today was a milestone for the ScummVM project, as we finally received the
long-awaited for e-mail from LucasArts Legal regarding the project.
<BR><BR>
Thankfully, they do not yet appear to have a valid complaint. Their message
requesting the removal of the site is based on the fact we are distributing
LucasArts own engine on this site. Of course, ScummVM is a fully original work
based equally on reverse engineering and original decoding work by many
different people in the community, so this request doesn't really affect us.
<BR><BR>We're safe for the moment, and will continue to work on bringing the
wonderful classics of the LucasArts company to your computing devices for,
hopefully, a long time to come!
