Hey all.<BR><BR>
I (Ender) am interested in finding out if any ScummVM users will be present at Linux.conf.au '03 here in Perth... if you'll be there, 
drop a post in the forum. If there are a few people going we might get together for Pizza or something afterwards, or maybe chuck 
together a last minute spontaneous Classic Gaming BOF (if somebody else wants to organise it, I'm a terrible person for that kind of 
stuff :)

Blonk.
