	<h1>ScummVM current areas of focus</h1>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to dig in, this is the place to find out what we're
		currently working on (or hoping somebody will pick it up for us,
		you never know). This is the stuff where you might make the most
		useful contribution, right now. Note that this is never complete,
		and may be partially outdated, so just because you don't see it
		here doesn't mean it is not important.
	</p>
	<p>Before you start work on something, you might want to talk to
		somebody from the team. This will help us to prevent double work,
		i.e. several people working on the same stuff at once without
		knowing about each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, always make sure to check out our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&group_id=37116&func=browse">bug tracker</a>
		and our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418823&group_id=37116&func=browse">feature request tracker</a>
		for things that need work.

	<h2>Future goals</h2>
	<p>Here is a list of things we plan to do for the future. Note that we don't promise to do any of these, nor when we will do them. It's just a list
	of what we hope to be able to do one day.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Music and sound effects in Indy3Ega, Indy3Vga, LoomEga, MonkeyEga, MonkeyVga and Pass</li>
	<li>Complete Full Throttle support</li>
	<li>Complete Maniac Mansion/Zak McKracken V2 support </li>
	<li>Add Maniac Mansion/Zak McKracken V1 support</li>
	<li>Complete support for Humongous Entertainment scumm games (he v6/v7)</li>
	<li>Complete support for Beneath a Steel Sky</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>General</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Make it possible to restart (scumm) games (properly, current CVS has debugger cmd)</p></li>
		<li><p>Allow the user to choose between multiple video drivers at startup when multiple choices are possible.
		E.g. between SDL vs. SDL_gl. Just like one can choose a midi driver. Currently one has to recompile for this.</p></li>
		<li><p>Add a "help" ingame dialog which lists key shortcuts etc.</p></li>
		<li><p>Add long style command line arguments that work in a portable manner across many systems ie --foo-bar as we are quickly running out of single letters to use for arguments, and they make more sense</p></li>
		<li><p>Fix handling of Kanji in FmTowns games (foreground is actually rendered on a second plane at 640x480)</p></li>
		<li><p>Improve support for non pc versions of games</p></li>
