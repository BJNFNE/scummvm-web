		<h1>ScummVM current areas of focus</h1>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			If you want to dig in, this is the place to find out what we're
			currently working on (or hoping somebody will pick it up for us,
			you never know). This is the stuff where you might make the most
			useful contribution, right now. Note that this is never complete,
			and may be partially outdated, so just because you don't see it
			here doesn't mean it is not important.
		</p>
		<p>Before you start work on something, you might want to talk to
			somebody from the team. This will help us to prevent double work,
			i.e. several people working on the same stuff at once without
			knowing about each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, always make sure to check out our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&group_id=37116&func=browse">bug tracker</a>
			and our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418823&group_id=37116&func=browse">feature request tracker</a>
			for things that need work.

		<h2>Future goals</h2>
		<p>Here is a list of things we plan to do for the future. Note that we don't promise to do any of these, nor when we will do them. It's just a list
		of what we hope to be able to do one day.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Music and Sound effects in Indy3Vga</li>
		<li>proper Full Throttle support</li>
		<li>Monkey1Ega support</li>
		<li>Curse of Monkey Island support (we already have that partially in latest CVS!)</li>
		<li>Maniac Mansion support</li>
		<li>Zak McCracken (non-FmTowns) support</li>
		<li>LoomEga support</li>
		<li>Indy3Ega support</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>General</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p><b>Rewrite sound code so that the Adlib and MIDI encoders can be active at the same time.</b></p></li>
			<ul>
				<li>This will help in a few cases where games have a few tracks only available in Adlib format</li>
				<li>Necessary if we want to allow users to switch between different games at runtime</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>Make it possible to restart (scumm) games</p></li>
			<li><p>Allow the user to choose between multiple video drivers at startup when multiple choices are possible.
			E.g. between SDL vs. SDL_gl. Just like one can choose a midi driver. Currently one has to recompile for this.</p></li>
			<li><p>Add a "help" ingame dialog which lists key shortcuts etc.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>New GUI</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improve the launcher</li>
			<li>Add tab support (i.e. allow multiple panes in one dialog)</li>
			<li>Implement the global preferences dialog (it is already there but nothing is wired)</li>
			<li><i>Ask: Fingolfin, Ender, painelf</i></li>
