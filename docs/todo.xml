	<h1>ScummVM current areas of focus</h1>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to dig in, this is the place to find out what we're
		currently working on (or hoping somebody will pick it up for us,
		you never know). This is the stuff where you might make the most
		useful contribution, right now. Note that this is never complete,
		and may be partially outdated, so just because you don't see it
		here doesn't mean it is not important.
	</p>
	<p>Before you start work on something, you might want to talk to
		somebody from the team. This will help us to prevent double work,
		i.e. several people working on the same stuff at once without
		knowing about each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, always make sure to check out our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&group_id=37116&func=browse">bug tracker</a>
		and our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418823&group_id=37116&func=browse">feature request tracker</a>
		for things that need work.
