<NAME>ScummVM code formatting conventions</NAME>
<DESC>This page describes the coding style we use in ScummVM.</DESC>
<BODY>
		<h1>ScummVM code formatting conventions</h1>
		
		<h2>1. Use common sense</h2>
		<p>
		These are conventions which we try to follow when writing code for ScummVM.
		They are this way mainly for reasons of taste, however, sticking to a common
		set of formatting rules also makes it slightly easier to read through our sources.
		If you want to submit patches, please try to follow these rules.
		</p>
		<p>
		As such we don't follow these rules slavishly, in certain cases it is OK (and
		in fact favorable) to stray from them.
		</p>
		
		<h2>2. Hugging braces</h2>
		<p>Braces in your code should look like the following example:</p>
		
		<pre>
		if (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
			[...]
		} else {
			[...]
		}
		
		class Dummy() {
			[...]
		}
		</pre>
		
		<p>Did you see the {}'s on that?</p>
		
		<h2>3. Two-space tab indents</h2>
		Says it all, really.
		
		<h2>4. Whitespaces</h2>

		<ol style="list-style: none;">
			<li><h3>Conventional operators surrounded by a space character</h3>
				<pre>
	a = (b + c) * d;
				</pre>
		
			<li><h3>C++ reserved words separated from opening parentheses by a white space</h3>
				<pre>
	while (true) {
				</pre>
			
			<li><h3>Commas followed by a white space</h3>
				<pre>
	someFunction(a, b, c);
	int d, e;
				</pre>
		
			<li><h3>Semicolons followed by a space character, if there is more on line</h3>
				<pre>
	for (int a = 0; b++; c < d)
	doSomething(e); doSomething(f);	// This is probably bad style anyway
				</pre>
			
			<li><h3>When declaring class inheritance and in a <tt>?</tt> construct, colons should be surrounded by white space</h3>
				<pre>
	class BusWheel : public RubberInflatable {
	(isNight) ? colorMeDark() : colorMeBright();
				</pre>
		</ol>

		<h2>5. Switch / Case constructs</h2>
		<pre>
	switch (cmd) {
	case kSaveCmd:
		Save();
		break;
	case kLoadCmd:
	case kPlayCmd:
		Close();
		break;
	default:
		Dialog::handleCommand(sender, cmd, data);
	}
		</pre>


		<h2>6. Naming</h2>
		<ol style="list-style: none;">
			<li><h3>Constants</h3><br>
			Basically, you have to choices:
			<pre>
	kSomeKludgyConstantName		// notice k prefix
			</pre>
			or
			<pre>
	SOME_KLUDGY_CONSTANT_NAME
			</pre>
			
			<li><h3>Classes</h3><br>
			Mixed case starting with upper case
			<pre>
	class MeClass() {
			</pre>
			
			<li><h3>Class members</h3><br>
			_ prefixed and in mixed case (Yo! no underscore separators), starting with lowercase.
			<pre>
	char *_someVariableName;
			</pre>

			<li><h3>Class methods</h3><br>
			mixed case, starting with lowercase.
			<pre>
	void thisIsMyFancyMethod();
			</pre>
		</ol>
