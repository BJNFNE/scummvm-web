<li>Monkey Island:
	<ul>
		<li>The intro crashes if you press escape at a certain point after the lucasfilm logo.  Patch <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=671031&group_id=37116&atid=418822">671031</a> tries to address this.

<li>Loom:
	<ul>
		<li>Not all of the distaff is cleared from the screen after weaving open on the egg near the start of the game. See <a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/tgray2/loombug.png">here</a> for a screenshot.
