<li>Graphics:

		<li>Verb coin does not undraw correctly, leaving behind artifacts
		<li>Some text does not undraw correctly, again leaving behind artifacts
	</ul>
<li>Inventory:
<li>Conversation:
	<ul>
		<li>The background of the conversation verbs is not redrawn properly. Specifically,
		if they are above actors, the actors are not always drawn when the verb is redrawn
	</ul>
<li>Actor:
	<ul>
		<li>The CHORE opcode still seems to be returning dodgy results
		<li>Lack of MouthSync stuff causes odd actor speech animations
		<li>Lack of MusicMouthSync will stop entry into Part 3 (hang during song sequence)
		<li>No ScaleSlot implementation means bad scaling
		<li>Actor occasionally gets stuck - related to scaling bug?
	</ul>
