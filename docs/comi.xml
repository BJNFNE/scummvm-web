<ul>
<li>Generic:
	<ul>
		<li>Lack of actorHit opcode breaks collision detection in ship-to-ship combat
		<li>Something is screwy with the cannon physics in ship-to-ship combat. You hit yourself. 
		(but the script still thinks you have won :)
		<li>Walkbox problems prevent you from being able to take the cup in the cannibal village on blood
		island without ignoring the boxes. Guybrush also seems to walk down from the sky when entering the room. See 
		<a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/tgray2/comi.s01">here</a> for a save. There are other walkbox problems
		in the game but you can normally just leave the room.
	</ul>
<li>Sound:
	<ul>
		<li>Music decompressor uses too much CPU for smooth music playback
		<li>Occasional crashes from 'sound que buffer overflow'. To reproduce, start ComI with -d0 -b605, hit
ctrl-g.. and don't move! The crash will occur within about 3-5 seconds.
		<li>Misimplementation of imGetMusicPosition kernel function breaks song sync in Part 3 intro
	</ul>
<li>Graphics:
	<ul>
		<li>Some text does not undraw correctly, again leaving behind artifacts (eg, conversation text, credits)
		<li>Masking artifacts. See many animations, eg during insult sword fighting
		<li>Verb coin is drawn behind inventory
	</ul>
<li>Conversation:
	<ul>
		<li>The background of the conversation verbs are not redrawn properly. Specifically,
		if they are above actors, the actors are not always drawn when the verb is redrawn. Some parts of the conversation 
		verbs are clipped (eg, bottom of g's), leading me to believe that their clipping rectangles are incorrect.
	</ul>
<li>Inventory:
	<ul>
		<li>Upon combining two items in such a way as to reduce a two-page inventory to a one-page, trying to select the last 
		item will actually return the second-last item
	</ul>
<li>Actor:
	<ul>
		<li>o8_getActorChore still seems to be returning dodgy results
		<li>setActorChoreLimbFrame isn't quite correct, eg Wallys animation after throwing the hook will show a few phantom
		frames of his 'throw hook' and 'standing at cannon' animation
		<li>Lack of MouthSync and MusicMouthSync stuff causes odd actor speech animations 
		(CVS hacked to generate random values... it's wrong, it's not synced, but it look better than nothing)
	</ul>
</ul>
