<li>Sound:
	<ul>
		<li>No SMUSH Audio: aquadran is working on this one
		<li>Voices 'pop'
		<li>Occasional crashes from 'sound que buffer overflow'
	</ul>
<li>Graphics:
	<ul>
		<li>Some text does not undraw correctly, again leaving behind artifacts
	</ul>
<li>Inventory:
	<ul>
		<li>Upon combining two items in such a way as to reduce a two-page inventory to a one-page, trying to select the last 
item will actually return the second-last item
	</ul>
<li>Actor:
	<ul>
		<li>The CHORE opcode still seems to be returning dodgy results
		<li>setActorChoreLimbFrame isn't quite correct, eg Wallys animation after throwing the hook will show a few phantom 
frames of his 'throw hook' and 'standing at cannon' animation
		<li>Lack of MouthSync stuff causes odd actor speech animations
		<li>Lack of MusicMouthSync will stop entry into Part 3 (hang during song sequence)
		<li>Actor occasionally gets stuck (e.g. after taking Wally's fake hook)
	</ul>
</ul>
