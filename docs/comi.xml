<NAME>Curse of Monkey Island - Known issues</NAME>
<DESC>This is a list of current issues that need addressing in SCUMM V8 support</DESC>
<BODY>

<h2>Status: Part 1/2/4/5/6 fully playable, part 3 playable with gameplay glitches</h2>
<ul>
<li>Generic:
	<ul>
		<li>Make the in-game options / save-load dialogs work.
		<li>strings that contain PU_M, EC_, SA_, or BT_ should not reach playBundleSound() as they don't
		have audio equivalents.
	</ul>
<li>Graphics:
	<ul>
		<li>Some text does not undraw correctly, again leaving behind artifacts (eg, conversation text)
		<li>Masking artifacts. See many animations, eg during insult sword fighting
	</ul>
<li>Actor:
	<ul>
		<li>o8_getActorChore still seems to be returning dodgy results
		<li>setActorChoreLimbFrame isn't quite correct, eg Wallys animation after throwing the hook will show a few phantom
		frames of his 'throw hook' and 'standing at cannon' animation
	</ul>
</ul>
