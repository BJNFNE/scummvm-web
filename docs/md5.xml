<h1>Scumm Data File MD5 Checksums</h1>

<blockquote>
	<p>All the MD5 checksums listed below are computed for the canonic "first" file of each game.
	This is usually a file like "00.lfl", "000.lfl", "*.000", "*.la0", "*.he0" etc.
	</p>

	<p>Note: this table is very very incomplete. For example, most games shipped
	in different languages. This table for now mostly contains english and german
	variants (and in some cases, the english variant is actually missing :-)).
	</p>
	
	<p>Furthermore, many platform variants are missing.</p>
	
	<p>If you have data files not listed here, or if the MD5 of your data files
	differs from the values listed here, please drop me a note so I can update
	the table. Email me at <em>fingolfin AT scummvm DOT org</em>.</p>
