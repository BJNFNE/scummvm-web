	<h1>0.7.0 Checklist</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	This is the test list for ScummVM 0.7.0, targeted for release on Christmas 2004.
	To achieve this release goal, we have to do tests with all our supported games, on as
	many different systems as possible. Everybody (including <em>you</em>, dear reader)
	is welcomed and encouraged to participate in this process.
	</p>
	
	<p>In particular, we need people who play through all the games listed below, and
	then tell us the results. If you run into problems, tell us; if everything works fine, tell
	us. Just be sure to also include the precise build of ScummVM you used, on what OS you
	were running, which game you were playing (obviously ;-), and any other info you 
	may deem useful.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please file bug reports for any not yet reported bug you encounter during
	your testing. If you believe the bug is critical, state so in your bug
	submission.
	Reports of successful completion should be posted to the scummvm-devel
	mailing list or our forums. Make sure you include the date of the CVS
	version you used to test and the operating system you used.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Please do all tests with binaries built from latest CVS, or the source
	snapshots/daily builds from the <a href="downloads.php#CVS">download page</a>.
	</p>
	

	<h2>Release critical bugs</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1007397&amp;group_id=37116&amp;atid=418820">#1007397 (WINCE: Disapearing clock)</a></li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Testing results</h2>
	<p>
	The following table lists the results of the current testing phase. For each game, there is
	a row in this table, and for each of our main operating systems, there is a row.
	Where they intersect, you will either see a + (if the game was tested successfully on that OS),
	a - (if there were problems), or a ? (if no test has been performed yet in this combination).
	</p>
	
	<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is important that we test each game once; it is not so important
	to test each combination of game and OS. So, please concentrate foremost on testing
	games which are not already listed as tested in here.
	</p>
