		<p>
			If you think you found a bug, take a look at our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&amp;atid=418820">bug tracker</a>.
			Maybe a similar bug has already been filed, in which case you can add a comment to that bug report. If not, you can submit a new
			bug report, but <b>please carefully read the instructions given on the submit form</b>. And of course, follow them :-)
		</p>
		<p>
			Feature requests should go on our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&amp;atid=418823">feature request tracker</a>
			(again first check if something similar has already been requested).
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, if you have made a modification to the ScummVM source code and want to see it merged back into the ScummVM main line,
			you can use our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&amp;atid=418822">patch tracker</a> for that.
