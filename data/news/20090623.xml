There are certain speculations about the case, some of them are really wild.
Unfortunately, no one approached any of us and there are only a few real facts in those blog posts.
</p>

<p>Thus, in attempt to stop these potentially misleading messages, I made a <a href="http://sev-notes.blogspot.com/2009/06/gpl-scummvm-and-violations.html">blog post</a>
on my personal blog. I hope that I provided enough information there, if not, ask me for more details.
