<p>Every now and then somebody will raise the subject of finding
a 'better' name for ScummVM, one that fits better with it's modern
scope (which extends well beyond SCUMM games). So
<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/ScummVM_Name">at this page</a>
we present you with some nice alternatives. Choose whichever suits you
best -- but we will stay ScummVM.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
