<p> Now, after more than two years since the original freeware release, The ScummVM Team is
	announcing update for <i>Dreamweb</i> packages.
</p>
<p> Thanks to work of Simon Sawatzki we got the game manuals as well as <i>Diary of a (Mad?) Man</i>
	awailable in form of text and HTML pages for majority of our releases, so you can use your preferred
	text-to-speech program to read them as your bedtime story.</p>
<p>	All releases now include these documents and are marked as version 1.1. Of course, previously available
	high resolution scans stay on the download page as well.
</p>
<p>Additionally we took an opportunity and released an Italian version of the game.</p>
<p>New packages could be downloaded from our <a href="http://scummvm.org/games/#dreamweb">Games page</a>.</p>
