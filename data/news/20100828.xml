You're Doralice, the sexiest airline captain of the Paris-Miami flight. During your last trip, a dying passenger asked you to deliver top secret vials. Will you succeed in your mission, avoiding deadly traps and solving every mystery?
</p>

<p>
Currently, the PC versions of <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/fascination">Fascination</a> are missing an AdLib player, but everything else is there.
Please note that the CD version requires some manipulations and the ScummVM tools to extract the <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Fascination">required files</a>.
</p>

<p>
Get the latest <a href="http://scummvm.org/downloads/#SVN">daily build of ScummVM</a> and your version of the game and give Fascination a try!
Please post any bugs and unrecognized versions you can find to our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&amp;group_id=37116&amp;func=browse"> bug tracker</a>, following
the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">bug submission guidelines</a>.
</p>

<p>
And if you find interesting and non-erotic sights, be sure to submit your <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">screenshots</a>.
