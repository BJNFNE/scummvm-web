It's been 10 years since we introduced the \"Modern Theme\" to ScummVM. </p><p>After all those years, it surely was time for an update.</p><p>Over the last couple of weeks, ScummVM team member mataniko carefully updated the theming of ScummVM. The new theme follows modern design principles while preserving our own design philosophy.</p><p>From now on, future versions of ScummVM <a href=\"https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html\">(including current nightly builds!)</a> will include the new theme by default.</p><p>Already missing the old theme? Don't worry! The old \"ScummVM Modern\" theme can be selected in ScummVM's options at any time.</p><p> What do you think about the new theme? <a href=\"https://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=14850&p=87219\">Let us know in our forums!</a> As always, your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>",
