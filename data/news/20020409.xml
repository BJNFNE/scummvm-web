<BODY>
        Thanks to several people, we have confirmed that DOTT, Sam and Max
        and LoomCD are all completable with no 'major' bugs in the current
        code. On the other hand, several serious bugs with MI2 and Indy4 have
        been found, so the 0.2.0 release may take slightly longer than expected.
        <BR><BR>
        To the coders out there, feel free to browse the bug list and take a shot
        at commiting fixes for them. At the moment there is only one person
        regually working on ScummVM, so things are slow.
