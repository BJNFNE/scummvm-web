<BODY>
	Travis Howell is making daily snapshots of ScummVM for Windows
	available for download. Kudos go out to Travis. Also, there is
	a link for a Windows SDL version of ScummVM. This version does
	not require the Cygwin dll.<br>
	We have also placed a Compatibility Page online to help answer
	the most common question, "Which games work?". We will keep this
	page updated as development continues.
