	"content": "<p>We need you! Join the Supernova crew for an unforgettable journey to witness the death of a star.</p><p>Have you ever dreamed of becoming an astronaut? Being abandoned on your own on a broken spaceship? Dying asphyxiated? Being electrocuted? Being shot at? Getting lost in a pyramid? Being caught stealing a dinosaur's head and being sent to prison? And if that is not enough you can even disable the improved mode in ScummVM and experience the frustration of clicking and pointing your way through a twenty-five years old computer game.</p><p>We are proud to announce that <i>Mission Supernova Teil 1: Das Schicksal des Horst Hummel</i> and <i>Mission Supernova Teil 2: Der Doppelg√§nger</i> are now both supported in ScummVM. In addition we have also translated both games to English and you can decide to play either in German or English. The games can be downloaded for free <a href=\"http://outpost.simplicity.de/\">on the developer's website</a>, so you have no reason not to play it!</p><p>Please help us test the games and report any bugs or translation issue you find on <a href=\"https://bugs.scummvm.org/\">our issue tracker</a>. You will need <a href=\"https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html\">a recent version of ScummVM</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/dists/engine-data/supernova.dat\">the supernova.dat file</a> (if it is not included in the ScummVM package for your platform). You can also see some basic information on the game controls <a href=\"https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Mission_Supernova#Controls\">on our wiki</a> or access the game manual in game using the F2 key.</p>",
