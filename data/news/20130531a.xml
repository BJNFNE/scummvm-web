<p>We announced 6 weeks ago that Google accepted ScummVM for the Google Summer of Code this year again.</p>
<p>We now know how many students Google assigned to us: 4 students will work with us this summer!</p>
<p>In order to tease you a bit, here is a short introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>RichieSams</i> will work on integrating Marisa Chan's Z-Engine, which concerns Zork Nemesis and Zork Grand Inquisitor.</li>
<li><i>Rundfunk</i> will focus on GUI extensions and improvement, with particular care for touchscreen devices.</li>
<li><i>Uruk</i> will port from Pascal to C++ the Avalanche engine, which concerns Lord Avalot d'Argent. </li>
<li><i>T0by</i> will work on our Wintermute engine and will fix several issues and add several features not present in WME light</li>
</ul>
 
<p>We'd like you to join us and warmly welcome to those four students and wish them all the best for the next 3 months.</p>
<p>We also are really grateful to Google to give us again the opportunity to mentor students this year and benefit their passion!</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
