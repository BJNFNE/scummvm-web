Unfortunately, that work is only about ¼th done, and we need your help.</p><p>Nevertheless, we would like to announce support for this game. All released versions are supported, including Polish original, German release and the Russian translation. Take your copy of the game and give it a try. You will need a <a href=\"https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html\">daily development build</a> for that. As always, please submit the bug reports to our <a href=\"https://bugs.scummvm.org/\">issue tracker</a>.</p><p>Also, if you happen to know Polish, German, or Russian, you are welcome to help us with the translation. The short instructions are provided <a href=\"https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Prince#Translation\">here</a>.</p><p>Powodzenia!</p>",
