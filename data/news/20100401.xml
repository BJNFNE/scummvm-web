<p>Today, we would like to announce support for Urban Runner! The game has finally reached a completable state in our subversion tree. Now you can play as Max as he runs from the cops for being accused of a crime he didn't commit. You might even fall in love along the way.</p>

<p>We would really appreciate it if you would go and test this game for us. When you find bugs, go report them <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&amp;group_id=37116&amp;func=browse">here</a>. When you have questions about reporting bugs, go <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">here</a>. Also, if you need a daily build, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#SVN">this page</a>.</p>

<p>We have also collected a group of screenshots:</p>
