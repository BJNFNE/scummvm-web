Observant users have noticed that there is an updated version of
Flight of the Amazon Queen on SourceForge but not, until now, on the
ScummVM <a href="/downloads.php">downloads page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apart from some minor typographical changes to the license to keep the
legal beagles happy, the only difference compared to the old version
is that it has been compressed using the latest version of the ScummVM
tools. This should fix problems with clicks at the beginning of some
speech, and speech being played a bit too slow. (ScummVM 0.12.0
already has a workaround for the latter problem, so you may not even
notice the difference.)
