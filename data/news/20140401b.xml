	<p>We do not normally announce new developers here, but we have an unusual and talented developer recently join the team, Edward Snowden.</p>
	<p>When we first got the e-mail from a dot-ru address which we will not be disclosing, we were skeptical.</p>
	<p>However upon verifying his PGP key, we are convinced that this is not some kind of April Fools joke and are happy to welcome a talented software developer with enthusiasm to the team.</p>
	<p>He is apparently a big fan of point and click adventures, especially <i>Beneath a Steel Sky,</i>, <i>Dreamweb</i>, <i>Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth</i>, and <i>I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</i>. His collection allowed him to pass a long stopover at an airport last year and he decided then, once he had sorted some personal issues to get around to contributing some code to ScummVM.</p>
	<p>As an avid fan of Larry Niven, he will be initially working on the TSaGE support for <i>Return to Ringworld</i> along with Strangerke, and will be using the nickname &quot;crazyeddie&quot;</p>
	<p>Please can we ask the other developers and users not to bother him about any issues outside of ScummVM and not to send any irrelevant e-mails to his ScummVM address at &quot;crazyeddie@scummvm.org&quot; Thanks!</p>
