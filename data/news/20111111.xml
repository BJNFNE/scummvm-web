<p>
It has been over 10 years. We are here thanks to the work of 131 developers. 49,124 commits
were made just to the ScummVM tree and those turned into a massive 1,085,714 lines of code
(comments are not counted) and of course over 7.6MM downloads just from the main site.
I would say, those were great ten years.
</p>

<p>
The outcome is ScummVM 1.4.0 which we are releasing today, 11/11/11 11:11:11.11.
</p>

<p>More games are supported: <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i> <small>(based
on same engine as Kyrandia)</small>, the kids' game <i>Blue's Birthday Adventure</i>,
the SF game <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i> and practically all supported Sierra
SCI games have now their Amiga versions working. Our musically inspired users will <i>MI2</i> and <i>Indy4</i> early SCUMM
games, CMS support in <i>Loom</i>, <i>MI1</i> and <i>Indy3</i>, and even <i>Winnie the Pooh</i> got looney tunes!
</p>

<p>Of course as always there are many more features and you can find the full list
