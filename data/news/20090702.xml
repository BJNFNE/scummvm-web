	<a href="http://www.snowball.ru">Snowberry Connection</a>, <a href="http://www.gobliiins4.com">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Pollene</a> and ScummVM issued a <a href="/presssnowberry">joint 
	press release</a>, which announces that the first three Gobliiins games are available as 
	bonus downloads for those who purchased Gobliiins 4 via <a href="http://gamersgate.com/DD-GOBLIN/gobliiins-4">GamersGate</a>
	or <a href="http://www.impulsedriven.com/goblins4">Impulse</a>. The games
	are also available on the DVD in at least the Russian and Hungarian releases of the game.
</p>

<p>
	We are really happy that these art pieces of classic adventure gaming are
	available as a relatively easy purchase now, and that ScummVM helped Snowberry
	to make them run on modern systems with minimal effort.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks, Snowberry!
