Some of the wonderful things you will no LONGER see in ScummVM include:</p><ul> <li>Glitches using an Ogg Vorbis talkie file in some games <li>Crashes on 64-bit machines <li>Crashes when saving to an invalid directory in Broken Sword 1 <li>Lots of sound glitches in Curse of Monkey Island, Full Throttle and The Dig <li>Crashes in some international versions of Simon the Sorcerer <li>... and lots of other annoying bugs! </ul><p>So don't delay, download today. Downloads are not yet available for all supported ports, such as non-ARM PocketPCs and the HandheldPC binaries. These should become available within the next week.</p>"
