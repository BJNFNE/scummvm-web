At 16:57 (GMT), on September 17th... I - ScummVM - will officially be a year old!<BR>
Unfortunatly, nobody told me when my birthday was, they told me I was an orphan! But I'm going to
try and throw a party anyway. So everyone is invited to attend my IRC channel, #scummvm, on irc.freenode.net!
<BR><BR>
If your someone like famous, or you like me, or whatever, and you want to pop in and say 'Hi!' to me and my <a
href="http://www.scummvm.org/contact.php">parents</a>... come on by! Or if you just want to send me a birthday card, or
RSVP for the party, go over to the Contact page and e-mail Endy or someone. Or post in my new shiny <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=210596">Birthday Forum</a>. We should be around pretty much all day.
<BR><BR>
If you want to actually meet a ScummVM developer in real life, and buy him (I don't have a mummy! Wahh!) a beer or something....
you can always drop a post in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=210596">Birthday Forum</a> and see
if theres anyone else in your area. I'm sure they would appretiate it!

Oh, and I lost a small, fleece sweater with three blue roses on it. If you see it, please commit it to CVS for me!<BR>
