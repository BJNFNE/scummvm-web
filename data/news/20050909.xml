The last bastion of the screenshots camp has fallen.  We have just received Zak v1 shots 
and that means that all is done.  Thanks a lot to you, our fellow users, who took part in 
this saga. There are too many of you to mention, but you know who you are.

We also need to test another couple of newly supported games.  These are Maniac Mansion 
NES version and Zak McKracken Commodore 64.  See sections 3.8 and 3.9 in our README on 
how to run these. We need to know whether these games are completable or not.
