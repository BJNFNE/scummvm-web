A few people have asked for further details on the TechTV segment featuring ScummVM.
Well, you can read the online article intended to compliment the segment on the <a

Don't know how to watch TechTV? I'm told those of you in America can tune into 
DirecTV channel 354, Dish Network channel #191, or locate the cable channel by 
following the instructions on <a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/grid?">tv.yahoo</a>

Or, if you just happen to have a C-band dish in the general vicinity of GE Americom 
Satcom C4 at the time of the show, it's on transponder 12 at 135 degrees west, 40 degrees elevation.

Those lucky Australians subscribed to Foxtel Digital can also watch the 
program. I have to try and find somebody with FTD so I can watch it myself.
