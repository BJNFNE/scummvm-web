		Grim Fandango was created on the peak of LucasArts games popularity. The ever-inspirational Tim Schafer in a fury of artistry packed together the best atmosphere he could create and the game was born.
		For a while there was great and steady efforts on creating an engine which would run this masterpiece on the modern hardware.
		The project is called <a href="http://residualvm.org">ResidualVM</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After more than 9 years of hard work, our "sister" project, <a href="http://residualvm.org">ResidualVM</a> has reached a stable state and 
		is now announcing their first stable release.
	</p>
	<p>	
		We survived the apocalypse! Let's celebrate that: grab your original of Grim Fandango and visit their site!
