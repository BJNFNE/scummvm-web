<p>
It has been pretty long time since the last release. Nevertheless the team is happy to announce release of ScummVM 1.3.0.
</p>

<p>
The release is truly feature rich, and particularly we are introducing support for new platform, WebOS, and added set of new games:
<i>Urban Runner<i>, <i>Playtoons</i>, <i>Toonstruck</i>, <i>Hugo</i> series, <i>Living Books</i>, <i>Backyard Basketball</i>.
Also we continued to work hard on SCI engine, so Amiga and some Macintosh versions of the games are supported now too.
Many of our ports got improvements, and number of bugs got fixed in practically every engine. Thus your gameplay should
be smoother, lighter and more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>As usual, the release is available from our <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads">downloads</a> page
and full release notes could be found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/1.3.0/ReleaseNotes/view">here</a>.
