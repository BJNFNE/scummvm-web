		for seven years in a row we are accepted as GSoC project.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe it is because both our project and the program have unusual letter case?
		Go figure, but in any case we're happy to be accepted and welcome fellow
		students to join our team and work on cool 2D Point and Click adventures
		<a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GSoC_Ideas">our project ideas</a>, but you always can offer your own (no, no Digger support,
		please. It's not an adventure)
