Good news: We've been accepted again to the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program!

So, if you feel adventurous (or RPGous) and would like to spend your summer with the cool team, we look forward to your application.

Fear notâ€”we will provide enough handholding, explanations, and support if you can dedicate time to coding on our project, are an open-minded developer ready to learn, and do not hesitate to ask any questions. We've been doing GSoC for the last 18 years (oh my gosh), so we know the drill.

A list of suggested projects can be found on [this page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2025). If you have your own idea, we will gladly evaluate it. For example, this happened in 2023 with the [Crab engine](https://blogs.scummvm.org/hax0kartik/). The required information for your application for our project is listed on [our Wiki](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=GSoC_Application).

To give you a nice boost, we have put together an impressive amount of information on the [Google Summer of Code miniportal](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code). So you can learn all the ins and outs of the process. But indeed, you need to start by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4cDsMNtcpG) and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team.

We are looking forward to your fine application and participation!
