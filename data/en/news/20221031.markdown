Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!

The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.

ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.

This update includes upgrades for the following engines:

* *AGS*
* *AGOS*
* *Asylum*
* *Ultima*
* *SCI*
* *SCUMM*
* *Tinsel*
* *Toltecs*
* *Toon*

Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.

Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.

You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on [our downloads page](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/). If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.

As always, the detailed list of improvements is available [here](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/2.6.1/ReleaseNotes.html).

Thank you for your continuous support â€” happy adventuring!
