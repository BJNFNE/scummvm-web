Once upon a time in the past - around the year 1994 - a software company called Adeline Software International released a game titled “Little Big Adventure” or “Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure”. This game, a classic pseudo-3D action adventure game with an epic story set on a fantastic planet, has now entered the testing stage in ScummVM. Please, note that a few features of the original game are not implemented yet. However, we also added a few features which are new for the game.

Features not available yet and known issues:

* The holomap is not yet available
* Changing the rendering details is not supported yet
* The credits sequence has a few rendering bugs

New features:

* An option to disable wall collision damage
* Improved UI navigation

This was all made possible by the people behind the [TwinEngine](https://github.com/xesf/twin-e) project and the LBA community.

Please test the game with the latest [development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html) and report any issues you find on our [bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
