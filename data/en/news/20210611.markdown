From 1940 to 2099, _Nightlong: Union City Conspiracy_ is now ready for public testing. Take the role of private investigator Joshua Reev in this cyberpunk-themed adventure released in 1998 by Trecision, featuring pre-rendered environments and 3D software rendering. Uncover the conspiracy, and all the bugs!

Thanks to the original developers for providing us the source code, and to SupSuper, Strangerke, bluegr and madmoose for porting it to ScummVM.

All Windows versions of the game are supported, as well as original savegames, check the [wiki](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Nightlong:_Union_City_Conspiracy) for required datafiles. If you don't own the game we have [demos](https://www.scummvm.org/demos/) available. To test you will need the [latest daily build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
