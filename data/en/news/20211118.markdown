After more than [10 years of development](https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2021/05/19/scummvm-asylum-engine/), the ScummVM Team is pleased to announce support for the psychological-horror adventure game *Sanitarium*.

Grab your CD version or a digital release and immerse yourself in a story full of nightmares and mysteries.

If you don't own the game we have a [demo](/demos/asylum/asylum-demo.zip) available.

You will need the latest [daily build](/downloads/#daily). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
