In 2019, Andrei Prykhodko (whiterandrek), a GSoC student, was working on support for the Red Comrades game series (Russian: Петька и Василий Иванович).

Red Comrades is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective.
The game's protagonists are from Dmitri Furmanov's 1923 novel Chapaev: historical Russian military figure Vasiliy Chapayev, his aide Petka, and the machine gunner, Anka.

After a long time in development, the ScummVM team is happy to announce support for the first two games in the series: _Red Comrades 1: Save the Galaxy_ (Russian: _Петька и Василий Иванович спасают галактику_) and _Red Comrades 2: For the Great Justice_ (Russian: _Петька и Василий Иванович 2: Судный день_).

So break out your copies of the games and give them a try! Unfortunately, only the original Russian Windows versions are supported. The English versions for iOS and Android use a completely different engine.

If you don’t own a copy, you can get the demo from our [demos section](https://www.scummvm.org/demos/). You will need a [daily development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
