After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce for testing the game [Chewy: ESC From F5](https://www.mobygames.com/game/chewy-esc-from-f5). This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks.. escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.

So if any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a [daily development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/#/snapshots). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/). Please note that the ScummVM version does have one obvious limitation, though.. the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work.
