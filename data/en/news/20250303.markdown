[Dark Seed](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Dark_Seed), a 90's point-and-click horror game from the mind of H.R. Giger, is now ready for public testing!

In the game you play the role of Mike Dawson, who just moved to a beautiful solitary mansion to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. You'll soon realise that the place harbors dark secrets, and you'll have just three days to escape a fate worse than death...

The DOS Floppy and CD versions are supported. The engine also supports a number of localised versions Spanish, French, German, Korean and Chinese.

The floppy version currently lacks sound effects but all other features from the original game should be present.

The engine also has the option of using the "arguably" better floppy music with the CD version if you have both.

To participate in the testing, ensure you have a [daily development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
