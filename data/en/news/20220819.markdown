_Soldier Boyz_ is the newest supported game of the [Hypno engine](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Hypno), and it’s ready for public testing!

Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionarie is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.

Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl), 
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!

ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is [a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COKWms0UBL8). Please [contact us](https://www.scummvm.org/contact/) if you have a demo or any other release.

To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a [daily development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily). As always, please submit your bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
