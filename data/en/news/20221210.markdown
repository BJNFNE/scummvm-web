We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports _Adibou 2_, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.

Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.

Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest [daily build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM, your own copy of _Adibou 2_, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!

You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.

Only _Read/Count 4-5 years_, _Read/Count 6-7 years_ applications are supported for now, but we hope _Science_, _Music_ and _English_ will come soon.

Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/) any glitch you may encounter.
