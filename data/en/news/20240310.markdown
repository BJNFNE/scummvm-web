For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program this summer.

The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.

Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.

ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on [this page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2024), but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the [required information in your application](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=GSoC_Application) before submitting.

We also strongly encourage you to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4cDsMNtcpG), in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.

Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a [Google Summer of Code miniportal](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code) to help you get started.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
