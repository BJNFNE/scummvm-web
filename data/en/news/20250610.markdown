It's been seven months since the first few qdEngine games were supported. After further work on the engine and playtesting, we are pleased to announce support for the remaining games:
* _Little Longnose_ (Russian: _Карлик Нос_, Lithuanian: _Nykštukas Nosis_)
* _Pilot Brothers 3: Back Side of the Earth_ (Russian: _Братья Пилоты. Обратная сторона Земли_)
* _Pilot Brothers 3D. The Case of Garden Pests_ (Russian: _Братья Пилоты 3D. Дело об Огородных вредителях_)
* _Pilot Brothers 3D-2. Kennel Club Secrets_ (Russian: _Братья Пилоты 3D-2. Тайны Клуба Собаководов_)
* _Features of National Fishing_ (Russian: _Особенности национальной рыбалки_)
* _Mom Don't Worry_ (Russian: _Мама, не горюй_)
* _Dog-n-cat: In the Footsteps of Unprecedented Beasts_ (Russian: _Агентство "КотоПес": По следам невиданных зверей_)
* _Dog-n-cat: Island of Dr Ratiarty_ (Russian: _Агентство "КотоПес": Остров доктора Крысарди_)

To play the games, you will need a daily [development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily). If you encounter any issues, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).

We are also still looking for a Lithuanian copy of the _Little Longnose_ game (_Nykštukas Nosis_). If you have a copy or know where to obtain one, it would be greatly appreciated by the team.
