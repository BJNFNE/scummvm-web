Are you ready to be sent to Camp ChillyWawa and Dr. Periowinkle's mansion as an intelligence agent?

Armed with a book of knowledge, or Pink Digital Assistant, your mission will be to save children from dangerous threats and undo a spell cast on a little girl who has been transformed into a wombat. To succeed you will need to visit several countries and even travel into the past. On your way you will encounter historical monuments and exhibits.

The ScummVM team is proud to announce that _The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril_ and _The Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink_ are finally ready for their testing period.

If you want to help with the tests, use the latest [daily build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM to play the Windows version of the games.
