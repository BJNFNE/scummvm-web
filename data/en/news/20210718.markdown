Last year we [added support](https://www.scummvm.org/news/20200521/) for games from the Ultima series including [Ultima 8](https://www.scummvm.org/news/20200524/).  Starting from the Ultima 8 engine, Origin Systems also created two other games in a quite different style: _Crusader: No Remorse_ and _Crusader: No Regret_.

We are happy to announce the first of these (Crusader: No Remorse) is now ready for testing in ScummVM.  If you have a copy of this game and are ready to take on the World Economic Consortium, grab the [latest daily build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM.  If you see any issues, please file them in the [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
