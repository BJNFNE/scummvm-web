_Backyard Basketball_, is finally ready to come off the bench for some sweet public testing! You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention __the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine__). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars _Kevin Garnett_ and _Lisa Leslie_!

Much like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your _110% Juice_ or _Dunking Donut_ for a _slamma jamma_! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.

Are you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest [daily build](https://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily)!
