A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.

No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!

Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:

* *Sanitarium*
* *Hades Challenge*
* *Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six*
* *The 11th Hour*
* *Clandestiny*
* *Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)*
* *Uncle Henry's Playhouse*
* *Wetlands*
* *Chewy: Esc from F5*

Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our [release testing list](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Release_Testing/2.6.0) - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.

And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.

The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.

All testing must be done with [stable builds](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/#/dailybuilds), not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).

A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our [NEWS file](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/branch-2-6/NEWS.md).

Thank you very much for your support!
