We've been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.

Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:

* _Orion Burger._
* _Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2._
* _Thimbleweed Park._
* _The Space Bar._
* _Moonbase Commander._ (with multiplayer support)
* _Backyard Basketball._
* _Unrest._
* _Rise of the Dragon._
* _Castle Master._
* _Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare._ (_Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца_)
* _Mask Show._ (_Маски-шоу_)
* _Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat._ (_Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы_)
* _The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik._ (_Похождения бравого солдата Швейка_)
* _Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday._ (_Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы_)

Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.

All testing must be done with [stable builds](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/#/dailybuilds), not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).

A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our [NEWS file](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/branch-2-9/NEWS.md).

We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
