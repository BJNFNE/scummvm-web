_Wetlands_, the newest supported game of the [Hypno engine](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Hypno), is ready for public testing!

This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.

Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and _Wetlands_’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.

ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well.
