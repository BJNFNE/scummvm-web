We are thrilled to announce that the ScummVM project was once again accepted for Google Summer of Code. This is always an exciting part of the year for us and this year is no different. For 2021 the GSoC program has been revamped by Google to be focused on smaller tasks and eligibility criteria for the students were relaxed.

With this in mind, our team has several exciting ideas for prospective applicants to explore, all of which can be found on our [ideas page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2021). Please review the [information we expect in your application](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=GSoC_Application) before submitting it.

You can learn more about the GSoC program and the tasks our cohorts contributed to in previous years in our [Google Summer of Code miniportal](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code).

So join us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4cDsMNtcpG) and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team.

We are all excited to be part of this program, and to see your applications!
