We're finally ready to unleash the motherlode onto the public for testing. The AGS engine has had many freeware games released over the years, as well as quite a few commercial games as well. Keep in mind that, like the stand-alone AGS interpreter the engine is derived from, only AGS games from 2.5 onwards are supported.

So if any of you are interested, try downloading some freeware games from [The AGS website](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/). You will need a [daily development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/#/snapshots). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/). It would also be helpful to let us know in the [#engine-ags Discord channel](https://discord.gg/eQYERyBc) which games you finish testing.
