_Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six_, the first supported game of the [Hypno engine](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Hypno), is ready for public testing!

Get ready to defeat Spideyâ€™s arch-enemies: Dr. Octopus, Hobgoblin, Shocker, Chameleon, Mysterio, and Vulture! ðŸ•·

Released by _Brooklyn Multimedia_ in 1996, this action-adventure game lets you play as Peter Parker, better known as Spider-Man. There are six different story lines and outcomes based on how you play and four difficulty settings.

ScummVM currently supports the English and Spanish releases out of the box. Support for the Hebrew release will be available soon. A German release also exists, but we need help finding a copy before it can be supported. Please [contact us](https://www.scummvm.org/contact/) if you have one.

To play any of these supported releases, you will need a [daily development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily). As always, please submit your bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
