<h3><a name="AEN6" id="AEN6"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN9" id="AEN9"></a><b>1.1.</b> Why is it called
ScummVM - what does this name mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Scumm comes from the fact that it was originally designed to run
SCUMM games, like Monkey Island. VM stands for Virtual Machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN14" id="AEN14"></a><b>1.2.</b> What is SCUMM?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>SCUMM stands for "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion".
It is a utility used to create the famous LucasArts adventure
games.</p>
<p>It was initially created in 1987 by Aric Wilmunder and Ron
Gilbert for the game "Maniac Mansion" and was used later, with some
modifications, for Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders.
Development on the SCUMM system continued for some time, and was
used in Loom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones and
the Fate of Atlantis, Monkey Island 1,2,3, Sam &amp; Max Hit the
Road, Day of the Tentacle, The Dig and Full Throttle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN20" id="AEN20"></a><b>1.3.</b> Is ScummVM free?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>ScummVM is released under the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GPL (General
Public License)</a>, so it's more than free. ScummVM source code is
freely available and you can do whatever you want with it. If you
make modifications to it and redistribute your work you MUST make
the source available. However, the ScummVM team would be pleased if
you choose to send them your modifications, so they can be merged
into the main tree.</p>

<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="question.supported-games" id=
"question.supported-games"></a><b>1.4.</b> What games does ScummVM
support?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>We have a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/compatibility.php"
target="_top">compatibility list</a> on our website that contains
an up to date list of what games work, and how well they work. As
well as SCUMM games, we also include virtual machines for the first
two Simon the Sorcerer games (by Adventure Soft), Broken Sword 1/2
and Beneath a Steel Sky (by Revolution), Flight of the Amazon
Queen, Gobliiins 1 (by Coktel Vision) as well as Inherit the Earth
(by The Dreamers' Guild). Other games may be added, but this is not
a common occurrence - see below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN32" id="AEN32"></a><b>1.5.</b> Will ScummVM support
other games?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The ScummVM team is currently focusing on bugfixes for our next
release.</p>
<p>We do <span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">NOT</i></span>
generally add support for non-SCUMM games! Reverse engineering a
completely new game without source is a long process, and our
developers are all very busy as it is... so unless you work for a
company interested in providing us with source code for one of your
classic titles, please do not ask.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN39" id="AEN39"></a><b>1.6.</b> When will Maniac
Mansion Deluxe be supported?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The short answer: never. The long answer: This game is a
fan-made replica of the original Maniac Mansion. It is not the same
game as Maniac Mansion Enhanced, which we do support. It features
improved music, sound, 256-colors graphics and reworked game
interface. It was made using the <a href=
"http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" target="_top">Adventure
Game Studio</a> which is a free, albeit closed-source graphics
adventures engine. There are Windows, Linux and FreeBSD versions of
the engine. Its author keeps his source code closed due to reasons
explained in the project <a href=
"http://www.bigbluecup.com/acfaq.htm" target="_top">FAQ</a> (see
last two questions). That means that you need to download that
program to play the game.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN46" id="AEN46"></a><b>1.7.</b> Where do I find
ScummVM?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>You can find it on the download section on our <a href=
"http://www.scummvm.org" target="_top">web site</a>. You can
download the latest version, which could be a little old. For the
most recent cutting-edge in-development version, you have to
compile it yourself from Subversion or use the precompiled 'daily
builds' linked from our download page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN52" id="AEN52"></a><b>1.8.</b> How do I compile the
source code for my OS?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The source code package contains a file called <a href=
"http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/README"
target="_top">README</a> that should explain everything.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN58" id="AEN58"></a><b>1.9.</b> On what platform does
ScummVM run?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>ScummVM should be able to be compiled on any SDL platform, with
just small modifications.</p>
<p>Currently tested platforms are Win32 (Windows
95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP), Linux i386 and PPC, BeOS, Solaris, Mac OS X,
Dreamcast, MorphOS, IRIX, PalmOS, WinCE, GP32, Sony PSP and PS2. It
is also part of the Free/Net/Open BSD ports collections and
included in Debian testing and unstable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN64" id="AEN64"></a><b>1.10.</b> Does ScummVM run any
non-SCUMM games?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes. As well as SCUMM titles, ScummVM supports Simon the
Sorcerer (1 and 2), Flight of the Amazon Queen, and the Revolution
Games: Broken Sword 1, Broken Sword 2, and Beneath a Steel Sky, as
well as Gobliiins 1 and Inherit the Earth.</p>
<p>Simon support was initially written by the original founder of
ScummVM as a separate program, and later included in the main
binary. Revolution Software Ltd. are very nice people and kindly
provided us with the source code to BASS and Broken Sword 1/2, from
which we based our interpreters. John Passfield and Steven
Stamatiadis kindly provided the original source code to Flight of
the Amazon Queen. The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. kindly provided
the sourcecode to Inherit the Earth. Gobliiins 1 was widely
researched by Ivan Dubrov.</p>
<p>We do not have any plans to support any other non-SCUMM games at
this time. If we do, it will be added to the <a href=
"compatibility.php" target="_top">Compatibility List</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you work for a company interested providing us with
source code for one of your classic titles, please do not ask us to
support a game.</p>

<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN73" id="AEN73"></a><b>1.11.</b> Can I use ScummVM to
make new games?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>While it is theoretically possible to write a new game that uses
ScummVM it is not advisable. ScummVM has many hacks to support
older games and no tools geared towards creating content usable by
ScummVM. Potential game authors are encouraged to look at open
source technologies such as <a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target=
"_top">SDL</a> for a cross platform DirectX like library, and the
<a href="http://www.lua.org" target="_top">Lua</a> and <a href=
"http://www.python.org" target="_top">Python</a> scripting
languages for game logic.</p>

<p>Most definitely. ScummVM won't work without them. If you would

<div class="answer">
<p>No. We do not have any plans to load old savegames (with the
exception of the Simon the Sorcerer series of games). Newer
versions of ScummVM have also broken compatibility with older
ScummVM savegames. Since ScummVM is in heavy development, this may
occur again in the future.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN113" id="AEN113"></a><b>3.1.</b> Does ScummVM
support CD audio?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, ScummVM fully supports CD audio in Gobliins (CD), Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade (FM-TOWNS), Loom (CD &amp; FM-TOWNS),
Monkey Island 1 (CD, FM-TOWNS &amp; SegaCD) and Zak McKracken
(FM-TOWNS). Just keep your game CD inserted into your CD drive when
you start ScummVM. If you have more than one CD drive in your
system, you can specify your CD drive using the -c command line
parameter. See the <a href=

support using MP3/Ogg/FLAC files instead of CD audio?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes. You can use LAME or some other CD audio conversion utility
to convert your CD audio to MP3. Since version 0.3.0 we also
support Ogg Vorbis files, and FLAC is supported since version
0.7.0. See the <a href=

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN125" id="AEN125"></a><b>3.3.</b> Does ScummVM
support using MP3/Ogg/FLAC files instead of the original MIDI
music?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>No. If all the game does is to play or loop a tune it would be
possible, but many of the games do fancy stuff like smooth
transitions from one tune to another, or turn individual
instruments on and off, etc. There's simply no way ScummVM could
take a piece of digital music and emulate that kind of
behaviour.</p>
<p>This question usually comes up in connection with Sam &amp; Max
Hit the Road (which has a few unusued bonus audio tracks on the CD)
and Monkey Island 2 (which is sometimes distributed on the same CD
as the version of Monkey Island 1 that uses CD audio). Both of
these games do far too much fancy stuff to even consider an idea
like this.</p>

ScummVM -- rather they just copy the game .exe and install some
shortcuts. ScummVM requires all game data to run, so you will need
to copy those manually. Look at the <a href=

</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>First, if you use a ScummVM version prior to 0.7.0 we strongly
recommend you to upgrade to the latest version, as we improved
support for mac games considerably starting with 0.7.0.</p>
<p>For newer games ScummVM needs the main data file, usually called
"&lt;Game&nbsp;Title&gt;&nbsp;Data" (where &lt;Game&nbsp;Title&gt;
is name of your game, such as "The&nbsp;Dig" or
"Sam&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Max"). Some CDs may appear to only contain an
application (watch out, it has almost the same name as the data
file, except that it lacks the " Data" at the end). In that case
there is still a separate data file but it is invisible.</p>
<p>There also exists a seperate <a href=
"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Mac_Games" target=
"_top">tutorial</a> for setting up Mac versions</p>
<p>The older games which have LFL files should only need the

for information on specifying the game platform.</p>

bug is reproducible, and still exists in the latest daily
build/current Subversion version. Also check the <a href=
"http://www.scummvm.org/compatibility.php" target=
"_top">compatibility listing</a> for that game to ensure the issue
is not already known. In your bugreport please provide the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ScummVM version (PLEASE test the latest Subversion/Daily
build)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug details, including instructions on reproducing it</p>
</li>

<p><a name="AEN228" id="AEN228"></a><b>4.11.</b> I downloaded the
Broken Sword packs from your site but the game won't run.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>These are not full games but reencoded cutscene (video) packs.
To run the games you still need the original disks. Originally
cutscenes were encoded in proprietary format and Revolution
Software kindly permitted us to reencode them into MPEG and
distribute them freely on our site.</p>

<p>Be patient. There are about 12 seconds of speech only and
eventually the Revolution logo will appear.</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>Make sure you have enough permissions to write in c:\windows
directory. Also note that this warning the first time you run
ScummVM, since the file does not exist yet then.</p>

<p>This problem has been reported to happen under Windows in some
cases. Check that you have the latest drivers for your graphics
card. If that does not help, try setting the <code class=
"envar">SDL_VIDEODRIVER</code> environment variable to "windib" and
try again.</p>
<p>Apparently other applications have had the same problem, because
the release notes for SDL 1.2.10 (May 17, 2006) contained the
following note:</p>
<a name="AEN254" id="AEN254"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>The "windib" video driver is the default now, to prevent
problems with certain laptops, 64-bit Windows, and Windows Vista.
The DirectX driver is still available, and can be selected by
setting the environment variable <code class=
"envar">SDL_VIDEODRIVER</code> to "directx".</p>

<p>This problem has been reported to happen under Windows in some

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN264" id="AEN264"></a><b>4.17.</b> How do I set an
environment variable?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>That depends on what operating system and/or command shell you
are using. Under Windows, you could try creating a file called
<b class="command">scummvm.bat</b> in the same folder as <b class=
"command">scummvm.exe</b>. Open this file in your favorite text
editor and put something like this in it:</p>
<a name="AEN270" id="AEN270"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<pre class="programlisting">
@echo off
set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=windib
set SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout
scummvm.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</pre></blockquote>
<p>You should now be able to run ScummVM by double-clicking on this
batch file, instead of the ScummVM executable.</p>
<p>On more recent versions of Windows, you can also set an
environment variable permanently, and for all applications, through
the control panel.</p>

<p><a name="AEN275" id="AEN275"></a><b>4.18.</b> ScummVM starts
somewhere in the middle of my two Xinerama monitors in fullscreen
mode. Help!</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>In fact, this is SDL problem. SDL does by default has xinerama
support enabled. Set the <code class=
"envar">SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD</code> environment variable to
"1" to start ScummVM (and other SDL applications) in fullscreen on
only one monitor. If this does not work make sure your SDL library
does have Xinerama support compiled in.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN283" id="AEN283"></a><b>5.1.</b> Will you add
support for zip archives?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>We will not do it. There are two main reasons for that. First,
we believe that it would ease illegal distribution of games.
Second, we already support compression of sound &amp; speech in
most larger titles, and use specially designed algorithms like MP3,
Ogg and FLAC, so you can already reduce the size of the data
files.</p>
<p>We as a team already discussed that question. We can't
absolutely exclude the possibility of changing our mind one day in
the future, but for now, we have no intentions to do so, hence
please don't ask us about it!</p>
